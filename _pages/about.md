Hi! I'm Jordan and you've found my home on the Internet.

I'm a Product Manager at Microsoft, working on [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and AI development.

In my personal time, I love gardening, playing music, photography, and being a full time dad.

Here on this site I share my thoughts and ideas, in the hopes it helps you out or entertains you ([read a bit more about my current goals for this site](https://jmatthiesen.github.io/general/hello-world/)).
