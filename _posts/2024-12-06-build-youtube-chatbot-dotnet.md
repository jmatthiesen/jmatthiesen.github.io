Recently on a trip for a tech conference I created a [YouTube chat app using .NET and AI](https://github.com/jmatthiesen/dotnet-ai-youtube-chat). This is part of my exploration into creating a larger app for chatting about .NET AI development (leveraging docs, presentations, and sample code my team has been working on at Microsoft).



This approach was inspired by a great LangChain tutorial on freeCodeCamp [^1] that I follwed when first learning about generative AI last year. I really liked it as a simple example, yet one that's useful for personal tools.

# New to AI?
If you're just getting started with generative AI development and want to use Python, it's a great tutorial - however I wouldn't recommend it any more since it's outdated now since there have been many changes to LangChain and the AI ecosystem since it was recorded. There are newer tutorials on freeCodeCamp for Python [^2] that you may want to checkout, or for my fellow .NET devs you could check out some of the videos from the recent .NET Conf event[^3], [^4].
