Hello friends, and welcome! After many years away from blogging, I find myself being drawn back...

I enjoyed writing off and on between 2005 and 2010, then came social media with Facebook and Twitter, and I dabbled there. I also had kiddos, focused heavily on my career, and life has just kept going from there. Let's see where this goes next. :)

For right now, my goals here are to write about things I think are interesting and think others will find interesting as well. Currently, my plans for topics include:
* Developing AI-based software using .NET and the C# programming language (my day job)
* My explorations around gardening geekery (learning about Permaculture!)
* Personal learnings & updates that I hope may help others out (career & hobbies)

Thanks for stopping by - and feel free to message me using one of the social media platforms you see listed here.
